# Verifying Verifiable Credentials

We know how to issue credentials, but how can we do to ask users for any credential, being it issued by us or another entity we trust?

In this tutorial we'll show a simple example building our Verifier VS from scratch, but also introduce a powerful and


### Requisites

To complete this tutorial, you will need any Linux/MacOS-based computer with:

- Docker
- NodeJS 18 or newer

### VS Agent set-up

As an active participant of the Verifiable Trust ecosystem, the set-up of a Verifier agent compared to an issuer is the same: we need to make sure to define an `AGENT_PUBLIC_DID`, since Hologram App will require to see the Proof of Trust before allowing users to presnet credentials to us.

So let's run our verifier VS Agent:

```
docker run -p 3001:3001 -p 3000:3000 \
  -e AGENT_PUBLIC_DID=did:web:myhost.ngrok-free.app \
  -e EVENTS_BASE_URL=http://your-local-ip:4001 \
  -e PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://myhost.ngrok-free.app \
  -e AGENT_ENDPOINTS=wss://myhost.ngrok-free.app \
  -e AGENT_LABEL="My First Hologram VS" \
  -e AGENT_INVITATION_IMAGE_URL=https://hologram.zone/images/ico-hologram.png \  
  --name vs-agent io2060/vs-agent:dev

```


### Requesting credentials by invitation code


The easiest flow for requesting a **Verifiable Presentation** is to create an invitation code for a `proof-request`. In this way, users will scan a QR with their Hologram app


For starters, we'll ask for a credential issued by our [Demo Chatbot Agent](https://dm.chatbot.demos.2060.io/qr), who will happily issue you a Phone Number credential when you select `Issue Credential` on its contextual menu (TODO: link to Hologram app tutorial about using it with Chatbot demo). Make sure to get a credential of this type in Hologram app before running this flow.

All we need is to generate a QR code by going to VS Agent's Swagger UI and scroll to [**POST /v1/invitation/presentation-request**](http://localhost:3000/api#/invitation/InvitationController_createPresentationRequest) method.

There we can try it out using the following request body: 

```json
{
  "ref": "1234-5678",
  "callbackUrl": "http://your-local-ip:4001/presentations",
  "requestedCredentials": [
    {
      "credentialDefinitionId": "did:web:dm.chatbot.demos.2060.io?service=anoncreds&relativeRef=/credDef/3YSvM4eydm7V9V5o9nWmVh5wbDi5F6fMGuf4L7hNwFyT",
      "attributes": [
        "phoneNumber"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

This will ask VS Agent to create a Presentation Request flow. Response will have the following structure:

```json
{
  "proofExchangeId": "8f305e13-fe62-4879-a6df-e0f28d4dda32",
  "url": "https://hologram.zone/?oob=eyJAdHlwZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vZGlkY29tbS5vcmcvb3V0LW9mLWJhbmQvMS4xL2ludml0YXRpb24iLCJAaWQiOiIxZmQwYjlkYi0yZWExLTQ5NmQtYjFjNy0xN2RhMmMwN2VmMzgiLCJsYWJlbCI6Ik15IGZpcnN0IEhvbG9ncmFtIFZTIiwiYWNjZXB0IjpbImRpZGNvbW0vYWlwMSIsImRpZGNvbW0vYWlwMj...",
  "shortUrl": "https://myhost.ngrok-free.app/s?id=f3574fd7-eb15-4ee4-b7cd-7ae36d82f511"
  ]
}
```

Again, you can take shortUrl to use for QR code scanning in Hologram App.

#### Setting our callback for presentation status updates

In the request, you'll note that we are specifying a **callback URL**: this is the endpoint where VS Agent will post updates about the flow (e.g. user scanned the code, user accepted the presentation, etc.). **ref** is an arbitrary string that we might use to identify the flow in case we use the same endpoint to get updates for all presentation flows.

So let's update our `message-logger.ts` (the one from [Simple VS tutorial](./10-simple-vs.md#receiving-text-messages)) by adding a `presentations` endpoint:

```ts
import express from 'express'

const app = express()
const port = 4001

app.use(express.json())

// POST /presentations
app.post('/presentations', async (req, res) => {
  console.log((`presentation flow ref: ${req.body.ref} status: ${req.body.status}. Claims: ${JSON.stringify(req.body.claims)}`))
  res.end()
})

// POST /message-received
app.post('/message-received', async (req, res) => {
  console.log((`Message received from ${req.body.message.connectionId}: ${req.body.message.content}`))
  const yodaSpeak = (text: string): string => text.split(' ').reverse().join(' ') + ', hmmm.'
  
  // Send a yoda-speak text message to the same connection
  const msg = { type: 'text', connectionId: req.body.message.connectionId, content: yodaSpeak(req.body.message.content) }
  async fetch('http://localhost:3000/v1/message', { method: 'POST', body: JSON.stringify(msg), headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } })

  res.end()
})

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server listening at http://localhost:${port}`)
})

process.stdin.resume()
```

#### Scanning the code with Hologram

When we scan this code with Hologram, we'll be directed to the Presentation Request screen:

<Image url="/img/build/intro/hologram-pres-req-invitation.png" floating="center" align="center" maxWidth="600px"/>

And in our backend (`message-logger.ts`) log, we'll see a line indicating that the user has scanned the code:

```
presentation flow ref: 1234-5678 status: scanned. Claims: undefined
```

Once we select a credential to present (the only one we have), we'll get into another screen

<Image url="/img/build/intro/hologram-pres-req-accepted.png" floating="center" align="center" maxWidth="600px"/>


And in the backend log we'll see now two lines: one to indicate that the user accepted the invitation, and another one showing that we received the presentation, revealing the claims we requested.

```
presentation flow ref: 1234-5678 status: connected. Claims: undefined
presentation flow ref: 1234-5678 status: ok. Claims: [{"name":"phoneNumber","value":"+5712345678"}]
```

### Using Hologram Generic Verifier

If you want to see a more advanced Credential Verifier built on top of VS Agent and related libraries, check out [Hologram Generic Verifier](https://github.com/2060-io/hologram-generic-verifier-vs). This is a NodeJS backend capable of using VS Agent API to create requests and render the credential contents in a web frontend. 

In the repo you will find a full guide to easily customize for your needs. You can see it working in our online [Gov ID demo](https://gov-id-verifier.demos.2060.io).
