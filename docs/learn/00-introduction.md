# Introduction

Hologram is an open-source messaging and agent platform that lets users and businesses run decentralized, end-to-end-encrypted chats, calls and AI agents.

Every agent or service proves its identity with verifiable credentials, giving users cryptographic Proof-of-Trust instead of relying on centralized platforms or intermediaries.

## 🚨 Problems with Most Popular Messaging Services

1. 🏢 **Centralized Control**  
   Messages, keys, and user data live on a single provider’s servers, creating a single point of failure, censorship, or subpoena.

2. 👁️ **Metadata Surveillance**  
   Even “end-to-end encrypted” apps log who you talk to, when, and from where. That metadata fuels advertising, profiling, and government requests.

3. 💰 **Opaque Business Models**  
   “Free” chat usually means your data is the product. Platforms monetize surveillance rather than protecting your privacy.

4. 🕵️ **Unverifiable Identities**  
   Anyone can spin up a username or phone-number account and impersonate a business or bot. Users get no cryptographic proof of who’s on the other end.

5. 🤖 **No Privacy for Business Integrations**  
   Business, brand or AI-assistant chatbots pass through messaging app owner servers, and external clouds that can read, store, or even train ML models on your content. “End-to-end encrypted” does not exist for these use cases. Services that require serious privacy cannot use these messaging services.

6. 🚫 **Lock-In & Poor Interoperability**  
   Each platform is a walled garden; your contacts, chat history, and bots can’t move freely to alternative apps or self-hosted servers.

7. 🚸 **Weak Parental Controls**  
   Age gating relies on self-declaration or platform policy, not cryptographic proof, so minors easily reach inappropriate services.

8. 🖼️ **Limited Content Provenance**  
   Forwarded media lacks verifiable origin or tamper evidence, fuelling misinformation and deep-fake distribution.

9. 💸 **Pay-to-Message Economics for Businesses**  
   On platforms like WhatsApp, businesses **pay per message** they send. This raises costs and locks companies into proprietary pricing.

> **Bottom line:** users and organizations trade convenience for hidden costs, loss of privacy, vendor lock-in, and uncertainty about who or what they’re really talking to.

## 🌟 How Hologram Solves These Problems

1. 🏢 **Decentralized Control**  
   Hologram uses **DIDComm peer-to-peer encryption** and lets you self-host your services and/or deploy them to any hosting company. No single server can block, censor, or subpoena the whole network.

2. 👁️ **Zero Metadata Surveillance**  
   Messages are end-to-end encrypted **and** routed over decentralized channels; Hologram logs **no contact graphs or timestamps**. Your relationships stay private.

3. 💰 **Transparent, Ethical Business Model**  
   Open-source code, no ads, no data mining. Ecosystems monetize via **privacy-preserving trust-fee flows** (pay-per-issuance / verification of credential) on the public good [Verana network](https://verana.io), not by selling user data.

4. 🕵️ **Verifiable Identities**  
   Every user, service, and AI agent presents **Verifiable Credentials**. A cryptographic **Proof-of-Trust** shows who you’re talking to before you engage.

5. 🤖 **Privacy-Respecting AI & Integrations**  
   AI agents run as **Verifiable Services** you can audit or self-host. No hidden cloud middlemen reading or training on your messages.

6. 🔒 **Open Standards, No Lock-In**  
   Built on **DIDComm + W3C Verifiable Credentials**, released under Agpl-3.0 for Hologram User Agent, Apache-2.0 for the SDK. Switch wallets, hosts, or forks without losing your data or contacts.

7. 🚸 **Built-In Kid Protection**  
   Services declare a **minimum age** in their credentials; parents set a birthdate + PIN, and Hologram blocks age-inappropriate connections, without exposing children’s data.

8. 🖼️ **Content Provenance**  
   Optional **C2PA signing** lets creators embed tamper-evident proofs of origin. Recipients can verify media authenticity directly in the chat.

9. 💸 **No Pay-Per-Message Fees**  
   Hologram itself is free. Any business can build its services and make them accessible at no cost.

> **Hologram replaces fragile, centralized chat with a decentralized, verifiable, and privacy-preserving trust layer—empowering users, businesses, and AI agents alike.**
